                    <p>The privacy of you and your team is one of our biggest priorities. Items saved in an individual library stay private to that team member. As a team owner, you cannot see the personal library of a team member—and they cannot see yours.</p>

You’ll be able to continue using Blinkist as before, just as a member of your team.
